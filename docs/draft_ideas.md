## Production versions üè≠

<!-- TODO: Remove this when resolved  -->

**Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è**: this section should not be implemented, as it is depended on the
entire project management workflow and it might be removed.

Some versions of the project will be used in the production environment. The
production environment is a final destination where the project will be put into
operation and thus will be used by the end-users. To ensure that the project
works in production it should go through testing and validation processes that
are specific to that project.

The testing entity (either IRNAS, the customer, or both) that performs these
processes has a final say if a specific version is suitable for the production
environment.

Taking the above into account, when a project version is being introduced into
the production environment two steps should be done:

1. Test and validation processes need to be documented and easily accessible.
2. When a version of a project is tested, validated, and signed by the testing
   entity this should be marked in its appropriate version entry in the
   changelog and release notes for easier later identification.

When marking a version as a production version please follow the below template,
**prepend it to the rest of the changelog/release notes**.

Try to keep the extra information to a minimum, if more information needs to be
communicated (such as tests, validation reports, etc.) those should be contained
in a separate linked document.

```markdown
### Production version

This version is used in production since _date_! This version has been tested
and validated by the _testing entity_ on _the testing date_ (or during _the
testing period_) and has been approved to be used in a production environment.
Documentation about the used test and validation processes can be found here:
_embedd link to Github, GitBook or something else_.

_Additional info here if needed._
```

Eventually, a new production version will be created. In that case, you should:

1. Perform the same steps as before, document test and validation processes that
   were used and mark a production version in the changelog and release notes.
2. Find the previous production version in the changelog and release notes,
   strikethrough the text related to the production version and add a text that
   points to the new production version, see example below.

```markdown
### Production version

~~This version is used in production since _date_! This version has been tested
and validated by the _testing entity_ on _the testing date_ (or during _the
testing period_) and has been approved to be used in the production environment.
Documentation about the used test and validation processes can be found here:
_embedd link to Github, GitBook or something else_.~~

~~_Additional info here if needed._~~

**This product version was superseded by the version _version number_. **
```
