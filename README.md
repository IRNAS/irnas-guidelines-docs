## Branching model 🌲

The IRNAS's Git branching model is based on the [GitFlow] branching model with some small differences.

### Key Concepts

Each repository needs to have two long-lived branches, `master` and `dev`.

* `master` branch should always contain production-ready code, which should be committed to it in form of a GitHub Pull Request.
Nothing should be committed to it directly (exceptions can be made for GitHub CI workflows, which can otherwise misbehave).
* `dev` branch contains the latest development changes for the next release.
Commits to it can be done to it directly or in form of GitHub Pull requests.

Besides these two branches, various short-lived branches exist in this workflow.
They can be classified into three categories: feature, release and hotfix.

* feature branches are used to develop new features.
They always branch from and back into the `dev` branch, never in `master`.
They are named as `feature/*`, for example, names `feature/new-board` and `feature/refactor` are both valid feature branch names.
* release branches are used for the preparation of a new release.
They allow for last-minute changes.
They are always created from the `dev` branch and merged into the `master` branch.
They are named as `release/<version>`, where `<version>` indicates the version of the next release.
* hotfix branches are used to address unplanned changes to the release in production.
The essence is that the work of team members can continue, while another person is preparing a quick production fix.
Hotfix branches must always branch from the `master` branch and merge back into it.

It is important that after every merge into the `master` branch a Pull Request is made from `master` back into `dev`, to bring in the changes that were made during the release process in release and hotfix branches.

### Deviations from GitFlow article

* Use `dev` instead of `develop`.
* When tagging tags add `v-` prefix, so `v1.0.0` instead of `1.0.0`.
* Use slash `/` instead of dash `-` when naming release, hotfix and feature branches, so `release/v1.0.0` instead of `release-v1.0.0`.

###  Feature branches

A few things should be kept in mind when working with feature branches:
* They should be focused on accomplishing one thing.
* They should be small, they should take up to 1 day of work to complete and to open Pull Request back into the `dev` branch.

This will enable smaller feedback loops, as Pull Request reviews will become more digestible for the reviewers.
